Description: Forced-choice (FC) response has gained increasing popularity
    and interest for its resistance to faking when well-designed (Cao &
    Drasgow, 2019 <doi:10.1037/apl0000414>). To established well-designed
    FC scales, typically each item within a block should measure different
    trait and have similar level of social desirability (Zhang et al.,
    2020 <doi:10.1177/1094428119836486>). Recent study also suggests the
    importance of high inter-item agreement of social desirability between
    items within a block (Pavlov et al., 2021
    <doi:10.31234/osf.io/hmnrc>). In addition to this, FC developers may
    also need to maximize factor loading differences (Brown &
    Maydeu-Olivares, 2011 <doi:10.1177/0013164410375112>) or minimize item
    location differences (Cao & Drasgow, 2019 <doi:10.1037/apl0000414>)
    depending on scoring models. Decision of which items should be
    assigned to the same block, termed item pairing, is thus critical to
    the quality of an FC test. This pairing process is essentially an
    optimization process which is currently carried out manually. However,
    given that we often need to simultaneously meet multiple objectives,
    manual pairing becomes impractical or even not feasible once the
    number of latent traits and/or number of items per trait are
    relatively large. To address these problems, autoFC is developed as a
    practical tool for facilitating the automatic construction of FC tests
    (Li et al., 2022 <doi:10.1177/01466216211051726>), essentially
    exempting users from the burden of manual item pairing and reducing
    the computational costs and biases induced by simple ranking methods.
    Given characteristics of each item (and item responses), FC tests can
    be automatically constructed based on user-defined pairing criteria
    and weights as well as customized optimization behavior. Users can
    also construct parallel forms of the same test following the same
    pairing rules.
